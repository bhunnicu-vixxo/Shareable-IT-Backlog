# Cursor Rules for Shareable Linear Backlog

## CI/CD Auto-Fix Integration

When CI tests fail (GitHub Actions / Bugbot), automatically fix common issues:

1. **Detect failures**: Look for test errors, lint errors, or build failures
2. **Auto-fix**: Apply fixes from `.cursor/rules/auto-fix-ci-failures.md`
3. **Commit & push**: Use format `fix: [auto] resolve CI failure - [description]`
4. **Loop**: Continue until all tests pass

**User commands:**
- "Fix CI failures" - Parse GitHub PR comments and fix all failures
- "Auto-fix tests" - Fix all test failures automatically
- "Fix lint errors" - Fix all linting errors automatically

See `.cursor/rules/bugbot-integration.md` for full integration details.

## Linear Issue Management

When the user mentions starting work on a Linear issue (e.g., "work on VIX-329", "grab issue VIX-329", "start VIX-329"):

1. **Automatically update the Linear issue** using `update-linear-issue.js`:
   - Set status to "In Progress"
   - Add initial implementation notes: "Starting work on this issue. Reviewing requirements and setting up development environment."

2. **During development**, when the user makes progress or completes features:
   - Update implementation notes with progress: "Completed [feature]. Working on [next feature]."
   - Add testing notes when testing: "Tested [feature] - [results]. Need to test: [remaining items]."

3. **When the user indicates completion** (e.g., "done with VIX-329", "complete VIX-329", "finished VIX-329"):
   - Set status to "Done"
   - Add final implementation notes summarizing what was completed
   - Add final testing notes summarizing test results

## Usage Pattern

```powershell
# When starting work
node update-linear-issue.js <ISSUE_ID> --status "In Progress" --implementation "Starting work..."

# During development
node update-linear-issue.js <ISSUE_ID> --implementation "Progress update..."
node update-linear-issue.js <ISSUE_ID> --testing "Testing notes..."

# When completing
node update-linear-issue.js <ISSUE_ID> --status "Done" --implementation "All work complete" --testing "All tests passing"
```

## Important Notes

- Always check for LINEAR_API_KEY environment variable before running the script
- Extract issue identifier from user's message (format: VIX-XXX or similar)
- Use descriptive implementation and testing notes
- Update issues proactively as work progresses, not just at start/end
